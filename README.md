# Library
The library of curlpp is a C++ wrapper library for libcurl, which is a widely used library for transferring data with URLs. libcurl provides support for various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, and others. curlpp simplifies the use of libcurl in C++ by providing an object-oriented interface that makes it easier to perform tasks such as making HTTP requests.
